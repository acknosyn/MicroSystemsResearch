# MicroSystemsResearch.com

http://www.microsystemsresearch.com/ is a website for MicroSystems Research Ltd. The intended purpose of this website is to create a space where people can find out who MicroSystems Research Ltd. is, what they do, what they’ve developed, how to contact them and to allow researchers to retrieve their GPS tracking logs from trackers MicroSystems Research have developed.

## Target Audience

MicroSystemsResearch.com is primarily aimed at researchers and biological organisations. Because of the nature of the products (i.e. Every product is made to order and modified to fit specific applications), the website is aimed at people that would need large quantities of products to conduct research. In fact, products are initially developed specifically for researcher’s and their requirements.
